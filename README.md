# Resonance Circuit

This repository contains the code and media files accompanying the video on youtube explaining RLC series circuits with an ideal and real capacitor (https://youtu.be/uD7PidABFKM). 


## Interactive Jupyter Notebook 

The file ``ResonanceCircuit_lcapy.ipynb``` contains interactive plots visualizing the basic concepts of resonance circuits

* Resonance frequency
* Bandwidth
* Q-factor
* Voltage magnification

and how they depend on the value of the components (RLC). 

### Requirements

```
lcapy v1.1
pdflatex v0.1.3
mpl-axes-aligner v1.3
```

## Manim 

The corresponding youtube video was created using Manim CE v0.13.0 running in a jupyter notebook. More information about the installation can be found on https://www.manim.community/. 

### Requirements

```
manim ce v0.13.0

```
